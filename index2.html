	In 2014, Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company that would later provide services for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, reached out with a request on Amazon’s “Mechanical Turk” platform, an online marketplace where people around the world contract with others to perform various tasks. Cambridge Analytica was looking for people who were American Facebook users. It offered to pay them to download and use a personality quiz app on Facebook called thisisyourdigitallife.

            	This is factually true! Except that it happened in 2013 and not 2014. I know it's just the introduction paragraph to the situation but most of the controversy was not whether Facebook sold that data but whether that company used it to affect the presidential campaign. The actual number of users affected was 50 million and that is indeed the quiz app that was used.

	About 270,000 people installed the app in return for $1 to $2 per download. The app “scraped” information from their Facebook profiles as well as detailed information from their friends’ profiles. Facebook then provided all this data to the makers of the app, who in turn turned it over to Cambridge Analytica.

	A few hundred thousand people may not seem like a lot, but because Facebook users have a few hundred friends each on average, the number of people whose data was harvested reached about 50 million. Most of those people had no idea that their data had been siphoned off (after all, they hadn’t installed the app themselves), let alone that the data would be used to shape voter targeting and messaging for Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.

            	It's important to note here the true extent of the impact and the difference between a direct app user and a "siphoned" friend user and the differences that Kogan/Cambridge Analytica treated them with. Initially, Kogan wanted to just use the data to run targeted ads, which is honestly totally fine- it's what these companies who pay Facebook do. Sadly, there seems to be no way to know the exact reach of CA on the campaign, although there were signs that they helped "increase voter turnout"

	This weekend, after this was all exposed by The New York Times and The Observer of London, Facebook hastily made a public announcement that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica (well over a year after the election) and vehemently denied that this was a “data breach.” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, wrote that “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false.” He contended that Facebook users “knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.” He also said that “everyone involved gave their consent.”

	Mr. Grewal is right: This wasn’t a breach in the technical sense. It is something even more troubling: an all-too-natural consequence of Facebook’s business model, which involves having people go to the site for social interaction, only to be quietly subjected to an enormous level of surveillance. The results of that surveillance are used to fuel a sophisticated and opaque system for narrowly targeting advertisements and other wares to Facebook’s users.

            	From Facebook's perspective, given the context of the situation, this is understandable. Facebook first knew about this in 2015 and immediately ordered CA to delete the data since it agreed that it was a breach. The issue stems from the fact that it turns out this data was NOT deleted. However, can anyone really fault Facebook for this? From their perspective, especially given the amount of knowledge they knew at the time, their claim isn't really incorrect. People will see ads and be under "surveillance" no matter what. On the other hand, it is important to note (2nd source) that humans are indeed heavily persuaded by persuasive communication (like ads) and that the potential impacts are indeed large.

	Facebook makes money, in other words, by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others. These are Facebook’s true customers, whom it works hard to please.
	Facebook doesn’t just record every click and “like” on the site. It also collects browsing histories. It also purchases “external” data like financial information about users (though European nations have some regulations that block some of this). Facebook recently announced its intent to merge “offline” data — things you do in the physical world, such as making purchases in a brick-and-mortar store — with its vast online databases

     			In everyone's user agreement when they use Facebook (which I know none of you actually read), you allow them to track this data. It is true that Facebook's true customers are not its users but the companies they sell ads too. It's kind of twisted when you think about it but it makes sense. Some of the techniques Facebook uses to be able to record these browsing histories, IRL data is by using cookies and then showing relevant ads to what you were browsing. Because NY Times leans liberal, this surprisingly doesn't downplay the situation at all.
