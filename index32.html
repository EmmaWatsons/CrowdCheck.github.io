	Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday that he made a “huge mistake” in not focusing more on potential abuse of users’ personal information, as the social-media giant he founded revealed that data breaches were far more extensive than previously known.

    Mr. Zuckerberg’s most direct mea culpa to date came as Facebook disclosed that data from as many as 87 million of its users may have been improperly shared with an analytics firm tied to the 2016 campaign of President Donald Trump, up from the 50 million previously reported. It said about 70.6 million of the users were in the U.S.

	Facebook released the higher figure in a statement laying out several updates to its service intended to better protect the privacy of users and increase their control over how their information is shared.

    In Australia, where Facebook put the number of affected users at 311,000, the privacy watchdog said Thursday that it is investigating whether privacy laws had been breached.

    In another revelation, the company said “most people on Facebook” could have had information scraped by marketers who used a feature that distributed profile data connected to users’ email addresses and phone numbers. Facebook said it has now disabled the feature.

	The disclosures came as the company is stepping up its efforts to repair trust with regulators and the public in the wake of several controversies tied to the election. Mr. Zuckerberg’s remarks, made in a conference call with reporters, served as a trial run of sorts for his testimony on Capitol Hill next week, where the 33-year-old billionaire is expected to be grilled on how the company handles its customers’ data.

    Facebook has about 239 million monthly users in the U.S. and Canada, and 3.2 billion monthly users world-wide.

	Facebook has come under heavy criticism after it was revealed earlier this year that the analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, obtained Facebook user information on tens of millions of users. It also faces questions over the proliferation of “fake news” and the presence of Russian operatives on the service during the race.

    In the conference call, Mr. Zuckerberg said he erred when he dismissed the threat of fake news as “crazy” shortly after the 2016 election. “What is clear at this point is that it was too flippant,” Mr. Zuckerberg said.

	He called Facebook “an idealistic and optimistic company,” and suggested it might have more disclosures to make soon. “We’re going to keep on looking for things, we’re going to keep on finding more, and we’ll update you then,” he said.

    Mr. Zuckerberg will testify before Senate and House panels next week. Late Wednesday two Senate committees announced a joint hearing on April 10 where Mr. Zuckerberg will appear as the sole witness. The hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee will focus on social media and the use and abuse of user data, according to a release.
