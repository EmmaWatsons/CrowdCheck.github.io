	Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified at a joint hearing of two Senate committees Tuesday, making the case that both he and the company he founded are very sorry for failing to protect the privacy and private information of Facebook’s 2 billion users.

    So if you’re a Facebook user, what does that apology mean for you? And how do you protect yourself from future data breaches? Read on to find out some practical steps you can take.

	While Facebook is fun and has become woven into many of our lives – often helpfully and pleasurably – it’s important to remember it is also fundamentally a gigantic data farm. Facebook harvests every last bit of personal information about us, our families, friends, and colleagues – without any transparency as to how or by whom that information will eventually be deployed. The company then makes billions of dollars with that information.

    Specifically, Congress is concerned with the Cambridge Analytica data breach that at current reckoning has affected 87 million Facebook users, and has called Zuckerberg to a double hot seat this week.

	Zuckerberg faced questioning Tuesday at joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees. On Wednesday he will testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

    But there’s a basic flaw in all the finger-pointing and handwringing over Facebook. Whether tech companies take responsibility or not – even if they have the will or the legislated mandate to do so – the question remains: do they have the actual capability to protect people’s data?

    Unfortunately, the answer is that no, the tech companies do not.

	The evidence over the past several years is pretty clear. We’ve witnessed an almost continuous pattern of digital breaches and exploits exposing the identifiable personal information – from credit card accounts to Social Security numbers – of hundreds of millions of Americans. 

    The death knell for the resilience of private sector digital security may have been the 2016 revelation by Yahoo that hackers connected to a foreign state-sponsored group “stole names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and encrypted and unencrypted security questions and answers from more than 1 billion accounts.”

	Our government is no better. The competency of some of our most sophisticated U.S. agencies and departments in this same realm was made equally clear in 2015, when hackers were able to steal the fingerprint records of 5.6 million government employees.

    Today, catastrophic fails by companies and official institutions to safeguard the most sensitive and private information of people are no longer a surprise. They are weekly news.

    If the current public and private sector stewards of our digital safety and privacy can’t protect us, then who can be trusted to make decisions about who can see and access your personal information? The answer is clear: You can trust yourself.
